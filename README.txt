This is my Engine. It supports all main functionalities:
-Load bakerHouse.
-Drop gltf objects.
-Camera Movement.
-ImGui windows (although at some point in development they stopped rendering and are oppened but they cannot be shown and I could not debug it, 	ImGui::ShowDemoWindow(); did not work neither.)
-Window aspect ratio and starter window size.
